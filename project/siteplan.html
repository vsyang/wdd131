        <h2>Website Content</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>I will name the website "Decadent Arrangements." This is the name my sister-in-law has chosen for her Charcuterie board business. The logo image in the upper left corner of the header was drawn by my daughter. The domain name could be www.decadent-arrangements.com if it's available (I plan on using Decadent Arrangements in the title).</p>

            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to educate consumers about what a Charcuterie board is and entice them to make a purchase for their upcoming events.</p>

            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>Scenario 1: What can I bring to my company pot luck?<br>‚≠êÔ∏è Charcuterie boards are rising in popularity for every event including a company pot luck. They are visually and mouth-wateringly appealing.</p>
            <p>Scenario 2: How much will it cost to feed a small party?<br>‚≠êÔ∏è Prices will range depending on what size of board you're interested in as well as the types of snacks you would like. Every board is custom made to your preference.</p>

            <h3>Color Schema</h3>
            <p>Utilizing coolors.com, I have selected a range of colors I would like to use to implement on the the site. *Still playing with colors so they may be subject to change</p>
            <div class="color-table">
            <div class="cname">Polynesian Blue: Header Font</div>
            <div class="example1">#064789</div>
            <div class="cname">Eerie Black: Body Font</div>
            <div class="example2">#171E0F</div>
            <div class="cname">Floral White: Main Background/Shadow1</div>
            <div class="example3">#FEFBF0</div>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Browsing through Google fonts, I have selected Ubuntu, Poetsen One, and Dancing Script. Here's a visual of what I had in mind:
                <p class="header">‚úß Dancing Script: H1 font (for the name of the site).</p>
                <p class="heading">‚úß Poetsen One: The rest of the heading font (h2 and h3). </p>
                <p class="body">‚úß Ubuntu: Body font.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>Using the Excalidraw website, I've drawn out a wireframe of how I would like the mobile and desktop view to look like.</p>
            <div class="wireframe">
